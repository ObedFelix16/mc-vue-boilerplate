# Vue Base Components

Under the `src/components/base` folder we store all the Vue Components that most likely will be used very frequently in our application.

All the components placed here need to be prefixed with 'Base' for them to be globally registered automatically.

## Examples

* BaseButton.vue
* BaseIcon.vue
* BaseLink.vue
* etc.
